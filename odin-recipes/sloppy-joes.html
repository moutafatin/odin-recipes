    <h2>What Is a Sloppy Joe?</h2>
    <p>
      A Sloppy Joe is a classic American sandwich made with seasoned ground beef
      and onions simmered in a tangy, tomato-based sauce, all piled onto a soft
      hamburger bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is believed to have originated in the 1930s in Sioux City, Iowa,
      where a cook named Joe is said to have created the original “loose meat
      sandwich.”
